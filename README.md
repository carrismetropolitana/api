# API v2

[![Better Stack Badge](https://uptime.betterstack.com/status-badges/v1/monitor/tf3p.svg)](https://status.carrismetropolitana.pt)

Welcome to the Carris Metropolitana API, an open-source REST service that provides planned services in JSON format by reading and converting the [official Carris Metropolitana GTFS file](https://github.com/carrismetropolitana/gtfs). This API covers bus transit
data for 15 of the 18 municipalities comprising the Lisbon metropolitan area. This is the same set of endpoints used by [carrismetropolitana.pt](https://www.carrismetropolitana.pt). With this API, developers can easily build applications that provide
users with up-to-date bus schedules and route information. If you have something in mind or already built we'd very much like to hear about it. [Get in touch!](https://github.com/carrismetropolitana/schedules-api/issues)

The Schedules API provides detailed information about _planned_ routes, stops and schedules.

If you have any questions or suggestions for improving the API, please don't hesitate to get in touch. We hope you find the Schedules API to be a useful resource for your development needs.
